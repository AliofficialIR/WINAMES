<h1>Frequently Asked Questions👽👻</h1>
<td>
  <li>🧧Note: The tool can only test the names of the Wi-Fis it has scanned</li>
  <li>🧧Note : You have to wait a while for the tool to scan</li>
  <li>🧧Note : This tool is designed in such a way that its test speed is related to your system. The higher the system power, the faster the test speed.</li>
  <li>🧧Note : This tool tests a large number of passwords, which increases the probability of cracking the WiFi, but it may not be able to crack some WiFis, in this case, you can edit the password list and add a new password to it.</li>
  <ti>🧧Note : This tool is the initial version and we will update it in the near future</ti>
